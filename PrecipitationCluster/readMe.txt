In the MatlabCodes folder three algorithms are present:
-	bufrtxtplot.m running which .dat files in txt_from_BUFR_input folder to the link https://www.dropbox.com/home/HSAF-HEPEXws/PrecipitationClusterTestData/txt_from_BUFR_input as input;
-	gribtxtplot.m running which .txt files in txt_from_GRIB_input folder to the link https://www.dropbox.com/home/HSAF-HEPEXws/PrecipitationClusterTestData/txt_from_GRIB_input as input;
-	NetCDFplot.m. running which files in NetCDF_input folder to the link https://www.dropbox.com/home/HSAF-HEPEXws/PrecipitationClusterTestData/NetCDF_input as input.

If you wants obtain .dat or .txt files follows the instructions in the ReadMe.txt file in the MatlabCodes folder or, alternatively, in HSAFprecipitationCluster.pptx.
